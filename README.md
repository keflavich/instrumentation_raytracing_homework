Ray Tracing Homework from 2009 Instrumentation Class
####################################################

I took an instrumentation course with Jim Green (Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
PI) in which the final project was to build a ray-tracing program that could
reproduce the COS optics, i.e., a mirror + grating system that would both focus
the light and disperse it.  The project was simpler than the COS problem,
since that also had to correct for Hubble's infamous bad optics, but was
fundamentally the same idea.

This repository contains the code I used for that project.  Some of it is
probably still useful.
